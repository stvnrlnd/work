## Issues
---
- [[2396-search-facet-analytics-report-fixes-updates]]
	- revision points, on hold
	- will have Shawn spin up new elastic db for this data, probably add index limts
- [[2574-sanitize-query-parameters-for-save-this-search]]
	- Related to above
	- right now just sanitizing url string, but not being sanitized, can use snitized url for search facet analytics report
	- Tag Steven
- [[2582-elastic-server-for-analytics]]
	- Tag shawn
- [[2556-add-intro-content-to-state-page]]
	- couple of hardcoded paragraphs
- [[2535-demo-new-plan-ranking-algorithm]]
	- Taylor wants to work on with Shawn
	- Taking featured plans and reg plans, merging
- [[2570-require-pro-customers-to-sign-in-during-checkout]]
	- right now when matching email is found, login popup shows, but can dismiss
	- do not allow pro users to continue without logging in
	- not a lot of thought about what should say or when should happen
	- May try to use different email
	- !! security concern: exposing that account exists (Steven thinks, Taylor verbalizes -- Taylor finds it annoying when sites don't tell you if email/username was found and password was wrong)
	- pro users may never checkout as guest, all other users can checkout as guest
	- Taylor: "something weird that's niggling at the back of my mind about trapping customers in auth modal"
	- Brian: "maybe we can create a new frontend for pro users, same backend"
- [[2549-rich-snippets-review-card-faq-product]]
	- on product and search page, just need to review for google standards
	- goal is to get featured on google
-  [[200-order-revisions-before-releasing-to-designer]]
	- restart, a lot has changed about order process and a lot more changes are coming
	- should be rewritten as a minimal update that allows some db_operations functionality
- [[2521-accessibility-audit]]
	- Do accessibility audit, come up with 2-6point tasks that get most bang for buck
	- Probably a lot of AI fixes
	- Maybe a Craig task? Was moved to Craig
