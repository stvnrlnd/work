# homestead.plus — Changelog

## 2026-04-10

- Captured core platform philosophy: Amazon-style transparent vendor identity (designer name, profile, and reputation are public and prominent) vs. ABHP's white-label model where the designer is hidden from the customer
- Documented ABHP delivery problems: inconsistent delivery methods (email / Dropbox / ABHP tool varies by designer), no lead time disclosure pre-purchase, customers surprised by weeks-long waits
- Added pre-purchase license agreement signing to the checkout flow in `user-flows.md` (license presented and signed before payment; recorded against the order)
- Updated `competitive-landscape.md` with the above pain points and expanded differentiators table
- Created `growth.md` — early adopter strategy, Designer Spotlight concept, public profile as anti-ABHP positioning, notes on competing while employed at ABHP
- Created `buyer-journey.md` — documents the "From Dream to Move-In" framework, the GitLab-parallel marketing angle, delivery tier concept (Visualization / Builder / Permit packages), and content/SEO implications
- Linked `buyer-journey.md` from overview

## 2026-04-09

- Defined product variant model: each floor plan product has designer-defined variants (e.g., 2BR vs. 3BR); variants carry their own price, specs, lead time, and files
- Defined add-on products: cost-to-build reports and material lists are a separate product type linked to a floor plan variant; purchasable standalone by existing buyers
- Adopted viewer-first file delivery: browser PDF viewer is the default; download is secondary and per-variant controlled by the designer; raw file URLs never exposed to the browser
- Defined lead-time order lifecycle: pre-auth billing, Pending → Accepted → In Progress → Ready for Review → Delivered status flow
- Defined services model: on-demand offerings with lead time (plan modifications, custom designs, made-to-order reports); price fixed or quoted (quote flow TBD)
- Defined teams/connections model: typed connections between profiles; one-way for customer→business and business partner endorsements; mutual acceptance required for customer↔customer (co-buyers) and business internal team members
- Confirmed Stripe Connect as the payment/payout model
- Set platform fee at 15% standard; 10% reduced rate available for qualifying businesses (conditions TBD); stored as per-business `commission_rate` override
- No subscription fee for businesses; pure commission model
- Paid placement slots (shop + directory) approved as secondary revenue; organic discovery remains the default
- Added `commission_rate` field to the business profile data model (needed to support per-business rate overrides)

- Added `revenue-forecast.md`: base case ~$117K Year 1, ~$420K Year 2, ~$840K Year 3 platform revenue; primary risk is SEO ramp speed and designer catalog supply
- Reorganized docs: split `tech-stack.md`, `revenue-model.md`, and `data-model.md` out of overview; created `user-flows.md` and `competitive-landscape.md`; overview is now a lean entry point
- Collapsed `Architect` and `Studio` business types into a single `Designer` type, following ABHP's industry convention; whether someone is a licensed architect is a profile credential/badge, not a separate business type

## 2026-04-08

- Created project documentation (`project-overview.md`, `changelog.md`, `roadmap.md`)
- Removed initial brainstorming doc (raw Ollama chat log, no longer needed)
- Clarified business profile model: Customer auto-created on registration; Business profile is opt-in with admin approval; any approved business can sell products or offer services regardless of business type
- Decided on two-level Parental STI for profiles: `type` (customer/business) + `business_type` column for business subtypes
- Decided to rename `studio_id` → `business_id` on products table; "studio" is a business type, not a special role
- Architecture cleanup tasks captured in roadmap Phase 0 (pre-production, no data migration needed)

## 2026-03-24

- Added `products` table and `project_floor_plans` table (migrations)

- Implemented `ProfessionalController` (index with role filtering; show with approval gate)

## 2026-03-23

- Added `projects`, `project_addresses`, `project_members`, `contacts` tables (migrations)
- Implemented `Project`, `ProjectAddress`, `ProjectMember`, `Contact` models
- `Project` statuses: Planning, Active, Complete, Paused
- `ProjectMember` access levels: Manager, Viewer

## 2026-02-26

- Added `profiles` table (migration)
- Implemented `Profile` model with STI via Parental; `Profile\Customer` and `Profile\Business` subtypes
- `Business` profile: status (pending/approved/rejected), 11 professional role types, JSON data for bio/location/contact

- Set up Filament admin panel (`/admin`)
